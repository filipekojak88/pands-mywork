# This program generates randomly salaries and ages within a range and plot that in a scatterplot

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

minSalary = 20000
maxSalary = 80000
numberOfEntries = 100

# this is so that the "random" numbers are the same each time to make it easier to debug.
np.random.seed(1) 
salaries = np.random.randint(minSalary, maxSalary, numberOfEntries)
ages = np.random.randint(low=21, high=65, size = numberOfEntries) 
# I don't like this, I prefer having absolute values set at the top.



plt.scatter(ages, salaries)    #this will be random
plt.show()
