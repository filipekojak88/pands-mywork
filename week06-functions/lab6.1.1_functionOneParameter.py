# author: Filipe Carvalho
def yo(a):
    return a * 2

# here we are calling the function yo
# and are passing in an argument, 3
yo(3)

# Question:
# 1 - Look at the program above:
# a) What will be printed out when this program is run?
# b) What would you have to add to the program to get it to print out what the calling the function yo(3) returns?

# Response:
# 1 - a)  Nothing as the "print" was not written in this script.
# b) I would have to right as per below:
# Option 1: print(yo(3))
# Option 2: 
# var = yo(3)
# print (var)
